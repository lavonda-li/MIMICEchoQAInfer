    "prediction": "B. The left ventricle appears to be enlarged, and the wall thickness is increased. While the image is a single view, it suggests left ventricular hypertrophy. The degree of hypertrophy is difficult to precisely quantify without more images and measurements, but based on the visual assessment, it appears to be mild.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n",
